<!-- Difference -->

1- Frameworks provide ready-to-use tools, standards and templates for fast application development and libraries do not
2- Frameworks control the calling of libraries for our code
3- Frameworks give rules and guidelines on writing your code and structuring files and folders
5- When you use a framework, the control is inverted, the framework controls the flow and calls your code,
but libraries let you control the flow of the application.
*Framework calls Code, Code calls Framework

<!-- why react is library -->

because of there are lots of options to do something and we have to choose our tools (packages) carefully
and create a proper design system for a specific project.
